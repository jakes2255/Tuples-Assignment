# Tuples-Assignment
Tuples in Python enables us to assign more than one variable at a time. 

Ref:https://www.guru99.com/python-tuples-tutorial-comparing-deleting-slicing-keys-unpacking.html

Difference between list and tuple is that list are declared in square brackets and can be changed while tuple is declared in parentheses and cannot be changed. However, we can take portions of existing tuples to make new tuple
